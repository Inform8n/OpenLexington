[UK Crime Log](http://www.uky.edu/crimelog/)
--------------------------------------------

((((DING DONG! [Code for America SAFETY AND JUSTICE](http://www.codeforamerica.org/our-work/focus-areas/safety-justice/)))))

Federal and State mandate to share this information ([Clery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clery_Act) and [Minger](http://www.mingerfoundation.org/legislative-work/minger-act/) Acts)

Jack scrapes it into CSV! Lives in CSV! Stores stuff in Google Docs.

Got the building management database and joined those onto the addresses!

(here is where we see a viz that isn't publicly available)

Tableau Public can't connect to the databases (Oracle's HANA, SQL, MySQL, APIs, etc) where the live data lives, only static.

Police department loved it and wants to do a live view! He got an a commendation from the Chief!

Campus Security Authority (CSA)
  - medical facility stuff, Residence Hall Advisors (RA) reported crimes, etc
    - "simple assaults" tend to expand figures of 'public crime'

Filter to residence hall or
Crimes by hour

Will be limited to six months view whenever it eventually is published by UK

Instagram (on Tableau but not visible yet)
------------------------------------------

All Instagram posts inside New Circle Road (Geo tagged!)

Lots of data here.

Jack wants to detect removed (deleted) pictures and sample that. What kind of things get deleted?


[import.io](https://import.io/) "Instantly Turn Web Pages into Data"

#### [Magic](https://magic.import.io/) scraper!

*miked hasn't had success with [kimono](http://kimonolabs.com/) or [Parsehub](https://www.parsehub.com/)*

*miked asks jack to do [July 2015 Food Truck Events](lexbeerscene.com/foodtruckevents/2015/July)*

[Weather data](http://public.tableau.com/profile/jack.king#!/vizhome/LexingtonWeatherHourly1-1-1950-4-15-2015/Sheet5)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Weather Underground has data by day (as endpoint) what about historical data?

Jack scraped it [import.io](http://import.io) and ended up with hourly data since 1950 (whoops!).

Once the data is scraped though... it's immediately out of date.

Tableau does have a solution for $500 a year. [Tableau Live](https://www.tableau.com/learn/whitepapers/memory-or-live-data)

You can see 0.10Â° increase projected over the next decade. In Lexington.
