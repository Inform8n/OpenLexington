Weather Underground has data by day (as endpoint) what about historical data?

Jack scraped it (import.io)[http://import.io] and ended up with hourly data since 1950 (whoops!).

Tableau does have a solution for $500 a year. [Tableau Live](https://www.tableau.com/learn/whitepapers/memory-or-live-data)

You can see 0.10Â° increase per year. In Lexington.
